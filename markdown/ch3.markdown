# Fourier Transforms

- fft/ifft (1D) [timing on real vs complex sequence -> rfft
- dct (1D)
  - compressed sensing
    http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/clevescorner-compressed-sensing.html

- fft2/ifft2 (2D)
  - explain fftshift to get spectrum in expected form
  - example: image notch filter

  - spectral method to solve, e.g., Poisson equation
    See arXiv:1111.4971, "On FFT-based convolutions and correlations, with
    application to solving Poissonâ€™s equation in an open
    rectangular pipe" by R. Ryne

- Radar example
  - In active discussion with source

- fftn/ifftn (3D)
 - Phase correlation from skimage

- convolution types: numpy, ndimage, signal.convolve, signal.fftconvolve
