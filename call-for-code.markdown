# Call for code nominations for Elegant SciPy!

It's official! Harriet Dashnow, Stéfan van der Walt, and I will be writing an
O'Reilly book about the SciPy library and the surrounding ecosystem. The book
is called Elegant SciPy, and is intended to teach SciPy to fledgling
Pythonistas by getting them to understand the most elegant code examples we can
find that use SciPy.

So, if you recently came across scientific Python code that made you go "Wow!"
with its elegance, simplicity, cleverness, and power, please point us to it! As
an example, have a look at Vighnesh Birodkar's code to build a region adjacency
graph from an n-dimensional image, which I highlighted previously
[here](http://ilovesymposia.com/2014/06/24/a-clever-use-of-scipys-ndimage-generic_filter-for-n-dimensional-image-processing/).

Each chapter will have one or two snippets that we will work towards. Each code
snippet will be credited as "written by/nominated by", and needs to be
published under a permissive license such as MIT, BSD, or public domain to be
considered for inclusion. We are preferentially looking for nominations in the
following categories:

- statistics (using scipy.stats)
- image segmentation
- Fourier transforms
- sparse matrix operations
- eigendecomposition and linear algebra
- optimization
- streaming data analysis

We'll also consider other parts of the SciPy library and ecosystem.

**We invite you to submit code snippets for inclusion in the book.** We'd also
appreciate a small description of about one paragraph explaining what the code
is used for and why you think it's elegant, even though this is often
self-evident. =)

Thank you,

Juan, Harriet, and Stéfan.
