Availabilities
-------------
St√©fan: I am out of action half of May, the whole of June, and part of July, so that may slow me down for the first full draft. 

Harriet: I'll be pretty busy in late July and August.

Juan: Most of August is out

Chapters/Ideas
==============
Based on: https://github.com/jni/my-documents/blob/oreilly-book-proposal/oreilly.markdown

*Preface/Introduction:* 

Why SciPy?

Who is this book for?

Ecosystem and community.

Conventions (e.g. NumPy docstring
conventions). Not sure if this fits here?

Definitions: What are SciPy NumPy matplotlib and pandas (or save some of these for when the are introduced?)

Getting Started:

Installation - Anaconda
Using IPythonNotebook and accessing the book materials

**Chapter 1:** Statistics, including numpy basics: memory layout, strides, F-
and C-contiguity, 1D, 2D arrays.

**Chapter 2:** Image segmentation using `ndimage.generic_filter`. This includes
an introduction to the NumPy array, memory layout, strides, F- and
C-contiguity, 1D, 2D, and nD filters, and finally filtering to produce a graph
and segmentation from that graph. (This may be broken down into several
smaller chapters.)

**Chapter 3:** Fourier Transforms. (Need to find a killer application/use for
this one, but it's a central enough topic that it will be a high priority to
include such an example.)

**Chapter 4:** Use of sparse matrices to evaluate clustering accuracy.

**Chapter 5:** Eigendecomposition. (Same as FTs.)

**Chapter 6:** Optimization. (idem)

**Chapter 7:** Streaming data. (idem, but specifically want to include use of
Matt Rocklin's Toolz)

**Chapter -1:** Contributing to the SciPy ecosystem: how to use git and github,
and follow best practices, to contribute to SciPy and related packages.

... Perhaps additional chapters with awesome examples using scikit-learn,
scikit-image, pandas, astropy, etc. The exact contents will be determined by
code submissions, which will be triaged to canvas as wide a footprint of SciPy
as possible.
